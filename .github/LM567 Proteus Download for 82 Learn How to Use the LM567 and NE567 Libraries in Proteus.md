If you are working on a project that involves tone decoding, you might need a library for the LM567 IC, which is a tone decoder chip that can detect a specific frequency in an audio signal. The LM567 IC is functionally equivalent to the NE567 IC, which is the industry standard part[^1^]. However, finding a library for the LM567 IC for Proteus, which is a popular software tool for circuit simulation and PCB design, can be challenging.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download the LM567 Proteus library for your tone decoder projects. We will also explain how to use the library in Proteus and give you some tips on how to optimize your circuit design.

## Step 1: Download the LM567 Proteus Library
 
The first step is to download the LM567 Proteus library from a reliable source. One possible source is the link provided in post 5 of this thread[^1^], which contains a zip file with the library files. However, you will need to register and log in to the forum to access the link. Alternatively, you can search for other sources on Google or other search engines, but make sure to scan the files for viruses before opening them.
 
Once you have downloaded the zip file, extract it to a folder on your computer. You should see two files: LM567.LIB and LM567.IDX. These are the library files that contain the schematic symbol and the simulation model of the LM567 IC.

## Step 2: Add the LM567 Proteus Library to Your Project
 
The next step is to add the LM567 Proteus library to your project. To do this, open Proteus and create a new project or open an existing one. Then, go to Library > Library Manager and click on Browse Libraries. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the zip file and select both LM567.LIB and LM567.IDX files. Click on Open and then on Add Library. You should see the LM567 library added to your project libraries.
 
Now, you can use the LM567 IC in your circuit design. To do this, go to Pick Devices From Libraries and select LM567 from the list. Then, drag and drop it onto your schematic editor. You can also double-click on it to edit its properties, such as its frequency range, bandwidth, output type, etc.
  
## Step 3: Use the LM567 Proteus Library in Your Circuit Design
 
The final step is to use the LM567 Proteus library in your circuit design. The LM567 IC has eight pins: Vcc (power supply), GND (ground), IN+ (non-inverting input), IN- (inverting input), C1 (timing capacitor), R1 (timing resistor), OUT (output), and VT (voltage threshold). You can connect these pins according to your application requirements.
 
For example, if you want to detect a 1 kHz tone in an audio signal, you can connect a 0.01 uF capacitor between C1 and GND pins, and a 100 kOhm resistor between R1 and GND pins. These values will set the center frequency of the tone decoder to 1 kHz. Then, you can connect an audio source, such as a microphone or a speaker, between IN+ and IN- pins. You can also connect a load, such as an LED or a buzzer, between OUT and GND pins. The output will be high when the input signal contains a 1 kHz tone within the bandwidth of the tone decoder.
 
You can also use VT pin to adjust the sensitivity of the tone decoder. The VT pin provides a voltage that is proportional to the signal strength at the input pins. You can connect a potentiometer between VT and GND pins and use its wiper as a reference voltage for comparison with VT pin. By adjusting the potentiometer, you can change the threshold level that determines whether the output is high or low.
