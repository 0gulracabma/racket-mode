## What is the Virtual Console Collection?
  
The Virtual Console Collection consists of two modules: Virtual Channel and Virtual Mixbuss. Each module allows you to choose from one of six meticulously modeled consoles[^2^]. The Virtual Channel is designed for use on individual mixing channels, while the Virtual Mixbuss should be the first insert of the master fader. When using the VCC across a mix, your DAW takes on the personality of a real analog mixing desk. The imaging and depth improves, instruments sit better in the frequency spectrum, and mixing becomes easier and more musical. You can even push the DAW faders up to find each mixer's "sweet spot" [^2^].
  
## How to Choose the Best Console for Your Mix
  
The VCC offers six console models to choose from: Brit 4k E (based on SSL 4000 E), Brit 4k G (based on SSL 4000 G), Brit N (based on Neve 80 series), USA (based on API), RC-Tube (based on RCA tube console), and Trid A (based on Trident A range). Each console has its own sonic characteristics and vibe, so you can experiment with different options to find the one that suits your mix best. Here are some general guidelines for each console model:
  
- Brit 4k E: This console is known for its punchy and aggressive sound, especially on drums and bass. It can add some edge and excitement to your mix, as well as some nice low-end weight [^2^].
- Brit 4k G: This console is similar to the Brit 4k E, but with a smoother and more refined sound. It can add some clarity and sparkle to your mix, as well as some warmth and depth [^2^].
- Brit N: This console is known for its rich and warm sound, especially on vocals and guitars. It can add some body and thickness to your mix, as well as some smooth saturation and harmonic distortion [^2^].
- USA: This console is known for its tight and punchy sound, especially on drums and guitars. It can add some definition and presence to your mix, as well as some punchy transients and crisp highs [^2^].
- RC-Tube: This console is known for its vintage and warm sound, especially on vocals and keyboards. It can add some color and character to your mix, as well as some tube saturation and compression [^2^].
- Trid A: This console is known for its bright and open sound, especially on acoustic instruments and vocals. It can add some airiness and spaciousness to your mix, as well as some smooth highs and mids [^2^].

## How to Use the Virtual Channel Module
  
The Virtual Channel module should be inserted on every individual channel in your DAW mixer. You can use it to adjust the input level, output level, console drive, noise reduction, group assign, group bypass, and console select parameters. Here are some tips on how to use these parameters:

- Input Level: This parameter adjusts the level pre-processing. Increasing the input level will allow you to hit the channel harder, which can result in more saturation and non-linearities. You can use the clip-LED indicator to see when the signal gets above the clip threshold [^2^].
- Output Level: This parameter adjusts the level post-processing, which is useful for gain 8cf37b1e13
