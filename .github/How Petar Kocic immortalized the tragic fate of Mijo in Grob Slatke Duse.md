They have a son, Rade, who is Mija's pride and hope.
  
One day, Mija receives a visit from a spahi (a feudal landlord), who claims that Mija's land belongs to him. He shows him a document that proves his ownership and orders him to leave. Mija is shocked and outraged. He refuses to give up his land, which he considers his ancestral right. He decides to go to the court and appeal to the emperor for justice.
  
However, on his way to the court, he faces many obstacles and humiliations. He is mocked by a kmet (a village headman), cheated by a priest, and ignored by a judge. He realizes that the law is not on his side, but on the side of the spahi. He feels helpless and hopeless.
  
Meanwhile, his son Janko dies of typhus. His daughter-in-law Mara remarries and takes Rade with her. Mija is left alone and heartbroken. He returns to his land, hoping to find some comfort there. But he finds it occupied by strangers who have destroyed his house, his garden, and his orchard. He sees his grave marked with a wooden cross that reads: "Here lies Mija Slatka Dusa".
  
He falls on his grave and cries bitterly. He curses the spahi, the priest, the judge, and the emperor. He prays to God for mercy and justice. He dies on his grave, clutching a handful of soil.
