In this article, we will show you how to use some of the features of Corel VideoStudio Pro X10 v20.1.0.15 (x86x64) to create a stunning video project. We will use a sample video clip of a sunset over the ocean, which you can download from here: [https://www.pexels.com/video/sunset-over-the-ocean-854797/](https://www.pexels.com/video/sunset-over-the-ocean-854797/).
 
## Step 1: Import and trim your video clip
 
First, you need to import your video clip into the VideoStudio library. To do this, click on the Import button in the upper left corner of the interface and browse to the location of your video file. You can also drag and drop your video file from your computer to the library.
 
Once your video clip is imported, you can drag it from the library to the timeline at the bottom of the interface. You can use the zoom slider to adjust the view of your timeline. To trim your video clip, you can drag the handles at the beginning and end of your clip on the timeline. You can also use the Split Clip button to cut your clip into smaller segments.
 
## Step 2: Apply a color grading preset
 
Next, you can enhance the colors and mood of your video clip by applying a color grading preset. To do this, click on the Color tab in the upper right corner of the interface and select Color Grading from the drop-down menu. You will see a list of color grading presets that you can preview and apply to your video clip.
 
For this example, we will use the Sunset preset, which gives our video clip a warm and golden tone. To apply it, simply click on it and drag it to your video clip on the timeline. You can also adjust the intensity and other parameters of the preset by clicking on the Options button in the Color Grading panel.
 
## Step 3: Add a title and an effect
 
Now, you can add some text and an effect to your video clip to make it more interesting. To add a title, click on the Titles tab in the upper right corner of the interface and select a title template that you like. You can preview and customize your title by double-clicking on it in the library.
 
For this example, we will use the Simple Lower Thirds template, which adds a simple text box at the bottom of our video clip. To add it, simply drag it from the library to an overlay track above your video clip on the timeline. You can also edit your title text by double-clicking on it on the timeline.
 
To add an effect, click on the FX tab in the upper right corner of the interface and select an effect category that you like. You will see a list of effects that you can preview and apply to your video clip.
 
For this example, we will use the Lens Flare effect, which adds a realistic flare effect to our video clip. To apply it, simply drag it from the library to an overlay track above your video clip on the timeline. You can also adjust the position and other parameters of the effect by clicking on the Options button in the FX panel.
 
## Step 4: Export and share your video project
 
Finally, you can export and share your video project with others. To do this, click on the Share tab in the upper right corner of the interface and select an output format that suits your needs. You can choose from various options such as File, DVD, Device, Web or Custom.
 
For this example, we will choose File and select MP4 as our output format. You can also change other settings such as resolution, frame rate and quality by clicking on Settings button in the Share panel.
 
Once you are ready, click on Start button to begin exporting your video project. You can monitor the progress and cancel or pause it at any time.
 
When your video project is exported, you can find it in your specified output folder or play it directly from VideoStudio. You can also share it online by clicking on one of the social media icons in VideoStudio.
 
Congratulations! You have ju
