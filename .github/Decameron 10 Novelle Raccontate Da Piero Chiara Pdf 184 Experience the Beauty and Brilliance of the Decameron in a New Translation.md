One of the stories that Chiara retells in his book is the famous tale of the three rings, which is also the source of inspiration for Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. In this story, a Jewish merchant named Melchisedech is summoned by the sultan of Babylon, who wants to trick him into confessing his faith and then kill him. Melchisedech tells the sultan a parable about a father who had three sons and a precious ring. He gave the ring to one of his sons, but then made copies of it and gave them to the other two sons as well. When he died, each son claimed to have the true ring, but no one could tell which one was the original. Melchisedech then asks the sultan which son had the real ring, and the sultan admits that he does not know. Melchisedech then says that the same is true for the three religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. They all claim to have the true faith, but no one can prove it. The sultan is impressed by Melchisedech's wisdom and spares his life.
  
Chiara's version of this story is set in Milan in the 1960s, where a Jewish banker named Salomone is invited by a wealthy Arab prince to his palace. The prince wants to borrow money from Salomone, but he also wants to test his faith and loyalty. He asks Salomone to tell him which religion is the true one, and Salomone tells him the same story of the three rings that Melchisedech told the sultan. However, Chiara adds a twist at the end. He reveals that Salomone had actually made up the story on the spot, and that he had never heard of Boccaccio or his Decameron. He had just used his imagination and cunning to save himself from a dangerous situation. Chiara then comments on how stories can be powerful tools for survival and persuasion, and how they can also be manipulated and invented according to one's needs and interests.
