## Step 1: Download ArcadePC Loader v1.4
 
You can download ArcadePC Loader v1.4 from [EmuCR](https://www.emucr.com/2011/08/arcadepc-loader-v14.html), a website that provides emulators and tools for various platforms. The file size is about 8 MB and it is compressed in a ZIP archive. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract it.
 
Once you have downloaded the file, extract it to a folder of your choice. You will see a folder named "ArcadePC Loader" with several files and subfolders inside. The main executable file is "Loader.exe", which you will use to launch the frontend.
 
## Step 2: Get the Games
 
ArcadePC Loader does not come with any games, so you will need to get them separately. You can find many Arcade-PC games on the internet, but be aware that some of them may be protected by copyright laws in your country. We do not condone piracy or illegal downloading of any kind.
 
Once you have obtained the games, you will need to place them in the subfolder named "Roms" inside the "ArcadePC Loader" folder. Each game should have its own subfolder with its name and files inside. For example, if you have the game "Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition", you should have a subfolder named "SSFIVAE" with files like "game.exe", "config.ini", "data.bin" and others inside.
