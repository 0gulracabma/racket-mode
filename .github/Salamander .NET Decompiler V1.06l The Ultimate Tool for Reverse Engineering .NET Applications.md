Once you have installed Salamander .NET Decompiler V1.06l, you can launch it from the Start menu or from the command line. You can then open any .NET assembly file and browse its contents in a tree view. You can also search for a specific type, member or symbol using the Find feature. You can double-click on any node to view its decompiled source code in a separate window. You can also export the decompiled code to a Visual Studio .NET project file or to a C++ header and source file.
 
Salamander .NET Decompiler V1.06l can also perform as a symbol server and supply Visual Studio debugger with the information required to debug assembly code. It can also identify local source code based on PDB files or fetch source code from source servers such as Microsoft Reference Source Center or SymbolSource.
 
Salamander .NET Decompiler V1.06l is a powerful and reliable tool that can help you understand, analyze and modify .NET assemblies. It can also help you recover lost source code or fix bugs in third-party libraries. It is a must-have tool for any .NET developer or reverse engineer.
  
One of the unique features of Salamander .NET Decompiler V1.06l is its ability to remove string encryptions injected by obfuscators. Obfuscators are tools that can make .NET assemblies harder to reverse engineer by renaming symbols, modifying control flow, encrypting strings and more.
