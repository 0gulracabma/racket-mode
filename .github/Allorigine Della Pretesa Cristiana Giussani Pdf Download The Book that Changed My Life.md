# All'origine della pretesa cristiana: A book by Luigi Giussani
 
All'origine della pretesa cristiana is the second volume of the PerCorso series by Luigi Giussani, a Catholic priest and founder of the Communion and Liberation movement. The book explores the essence and origin of Christianity, that is, the religious experience of Christ. After an introduction that summarizes the main points of the previous volume on the religious sense, Giussani helps the reader to understand how humans in all times have felt the need to relate to a mystery that transcends them and gives meaning to their existence. He then shows how this mystery has revealed itself in history through the person of Jesus of Nazareth, who claimed to be God made flesh and invited everyone to follow him. Giussani argues that Christianity is not a doctrine or a moral code, but an event of encounter and relationship with Christ, who is alive and present in his Church and in his people. He also addresses some common objections and questions about Christianity, such as the problem of evil, the uniqueness of Christ, the role of reason and freedom, and the relationship with other religions.
 
The book is based on Giussani's lectures and dialogues with students and young people, and it aims to offer a clear and compelling presentation of the Christian faith that can challenge and inspire readers of different backgrounds and cultures. The book is part of a trilogy that includes The Religious Sense and At the Origin of the Christian Claim.

All'origine della pretesa cristiana is a book that can enrich and challenge anyone who wants to discover or deepen their understanding of Christianity. It is a book that can help the reader to encounter Christ as the answer to their ultimate questions and desires.

One of the main themes of All'origine della pretesa cristiana is the relationship between faith and reason. Giussani argues that faith is not a blind leap or a subjective feeling, but a rational response to the evidence of reality. He shows how reason can lead to faith by recognizing the signs of God's presence and action in history and in the human heart. He also shows how faith can enrich and expand reason by opening it to the mystery of God and his revelation in Christ. Giussani challenges the modern tendency to reduce reason to scientific rationality or to relativize it to personal opinions. He proposes instead a reason that is open to the whole of reality and that seeks the ultimate meaning and origin of everything.
 
Another theme of the book is the relationship between Christianity and culture. Giussani affirms that Christianity is not a foreign or hostile element to human culture, but rather its source and fulfillment. He explains how Christianity has shaped and influenced the development of Western civilization and culture, especially in the fields of art, literature, philosophy, law, and human rights. He also explains how Christianity can dialogue and interact with other cultures and religions, respecting their diversity and uniqueness, but also offering them the possibility of encountering Christ as the universal Savior and Lord. Giussani stresses the importance of culture as a way of expressing and communicating the human experience of reality, and he invites Christians to be active and creative in contributing to the cultural life of society.
