## Step 3: Create a Noise Profile for Your Clip
  
A noise profile is a representation of the noise characteristics of your clip, which helps Neat Video 3.2 Pro to identify and remove the noise more accurately. To create a noise profile, you need to select a sample area of your clip that contains only noise and no details.
  
You can do this by using the Auto Profile tool, which automatically selects a suitable area for you, or by manually drawing a rectangle over a noisy area using the Select Area tool. You can also adjust the size and position of the sample area using the Zoom and Pan tools.
  
After selecting a sample area, click on the Analyze button to let Neat Video 3.2 Pro analyze the noise in that area and create a noise profile. You will see a preview of the noise profile in the Noise Profile Preview window.
  
## Step 4: Adjust the Noise Reduction Settings
  
Once you have created a noise profile, you can move on to the Noise Reduction Settings tab, where you can adjust how much noise reduction you want to apply to your clip. You can use the default settings or tweak them according to your preferences.
  
The main settings are:
 
- Temporal Filter: This controls how much temporal noise reduction is applied, which means how much Neat Video 3.2 Pro compares consecutive frames of your clip to reduce flickering and random noise.
- Spatial Filter: This controls how much spatial noise reduction is applied, which means how much Neat Video 3.2 Pro smooths out the pixels within each frame of your clip to reduce static noise and grain.
- Sharpening: This controls how much sharpening is applied after noise reduction, which helps to restore some of the details and edges that might have been lost due to smoothing.

You can adjust these settings by using the sliders or by entering numerical values. You can also use the presets menu to choose from different levels of noise reduction and sharpening.
  
You can preview the results of your settings in the Preview window
